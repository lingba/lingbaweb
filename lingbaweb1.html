When I was in the third grade of elementary school, my friend taught me how to draw character,
 and I started to make characters and I was <strong><u>interested</u></strong> in it.
<br>As I create characters and draw webtoon with my phone,
I was satisfied with the work,
and I started to think about wedtoonist.</p>
